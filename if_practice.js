// 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

// 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

// 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

// 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.

// 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

// 6. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.

// 7. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.

// 8. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.

// 9. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.

// 10. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).
