// #  1. Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
// #     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26.

// #  2. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string.
// #     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "volleyballbasketballbadminton".

// #  3. Start with an array of hashes and compute the sum of the prices (from the :price key).
// #     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes 105.

// #  4. Start with an array of numbers and compute the the minumum number.
// #     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3, 9] becomes 3.

// #  5. Start with an array of strings and compute the total length of all the strings.
// #     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes 29.

// #  6. Start with an array of hashes and find the hash with the lowest price (from the :price key).
// #     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes {name: "pencil", price: 1}.

// #  7. Start with an array of numbers and compute product of all the numbers.
// #     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 1200.

// #  8. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string, separated by dashes.
// #     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "-volleyball-basketball-badminton-".

// #  9. Start with an array of hashes and find the hash with the shortest name (from the :name key).
// #     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes {name: "book", price: 4}.

// # 10. Start with an array of numbers and compute the maximum number.
// #     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 10.
